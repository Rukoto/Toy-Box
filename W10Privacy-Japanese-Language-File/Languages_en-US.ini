ueber=(c)2021 by Bernd Schuster||W10Privacy has been developed to give users an easy way to clearly display common|Windows (security) settings. Desired settings can be activated via the program, or once set,|can be disabled, too.||The program offers also a silent mode: you have the ability to check carried out and saved settings|at defined intervals and correct in the meantime changed settings automatically.||W10Privacy is provided as freeware, excluding any warranty or liability!|The software is developed and tested in my spare time to the best of my knowledge and belief.||Of course, there cannot be fully included all constellations of the Windows world!|Feedback on opportunities for improvement, problems or additional options is always welcome.
